# MysqlExport
**Description:** Export the databases with php.
***
**Why I created this class?** <br />
I have a vps and I tired of manual backup. I decided to backup the databases automatically with cronjob then I created this class.
<br />
If you see an error or optimization please don't hesitate.<br />
**TODO**<br />
Class isn't suitable for tables which has foreign keys. I'll update the class.
